## Data of CCVT pre-initial conditions

This repository contains some CCVT pre-initial conditions data
which were generated by [the ccvt-preic code](https://github.com/liaoshong/ccvt-preic).
Usually, these data cost more computational time to compute. We
make them publicly available so that the community can use them easily.
This repository may add more data in the future.

You can download each data file, or download all data as a .zip
archive in [this webpage](https://github.com/liaoshong/ccvt-preic-data).
Also, you can use git to clone this repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/liaoshong/ccvt-preic-data.git
```

The *BOX_SIZE* parameter used in computing these data is *1.0*. Please
refer to the *user guide* of [the ccvt-preic code](https://github.com/liaoshong/ccvt-preic)
for the naming convention, file format and usage of these files.
For the details of the CCVT method to produce pre-initial conditions,
please refer to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03574).
